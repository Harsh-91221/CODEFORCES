/*Explanation-> Polycarp has guessed three positive integers a, b and c.
He keeps these numbers in secret, but he writes down four numbers on a board in arbitrary order â€”
their pairwise sums (three numbers) and sum of all three numbers (one number).
So, there are four numbers on a board in random order: a+b, a+c, b+c and a+b+c.

You have to guess three numbers a, b and c using given numbers. Print three guessed integers in any order.*/
