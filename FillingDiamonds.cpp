/*Explanation-> You have integer n.
Calculate how many ways are there to fully cover belt-like area of 4nâˆ’2 triangles with diamond shapes.
Diamond shape consists of two triangles. You can move, rotate or flip the shape, but you cannot scale it.
2 coverings are different if some 2 triangles are covered by the same diamond shape
